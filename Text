<p class="text-sm-start">Start aligned text on viewports sized SM (small) or wider.</p>

Text wrapping and overflow

Wrap text with a .text-wrap class.
This text should wrap.

<div class="badge bg-primary text-wrap" style="width: 6rem;">
  This text should wrap.
</div>

Prevent text from wrapping with a .text-nowrap class.
This text should overflow the parent.

<div class="text-nowrap bg-light border" style="width: 8rem;">
  This text should overflow the parent.
</div>

Word break

Prevent long strings of text from breaking your components’ layout by using .text-break to set word-wrap: break-word and word-break: break-word. We use word-wrap instead of the more common overflow-wrap for wider browser support, and add the deprecated word-break: break-word to avoid issues with flex containers.

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
html

<p class="text-break">mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm</p>

Text transform

Transform text in components with text capitalization classes.

Lowercased text.

Uppercased text.

CapiTaliZed text.
html

<p class="text-lowercase">Lowercased text.</p>
<p class="text-uppercase">Uppercased text.</p>
<p class="text-capitalize">CapiTaliZed text.</p>

Note how .text-capitalize only changes the first letter of each word, leaving the case of any other letters unaffected.
Font size

Quickly change the font-size of text. While our heading classes (e.g., .h1–.h6) apply font-size, font-weight, and line-height, these utilities only apply font-size. Sizing for these utilities matches HTML’s heading elements, so as the number increases, their size decreases.

.fs-1 text

.fs-2 text

.fs-3 text

.fs-4 text

.fs-5 text

.fs-6 text
html

<p class="fs-1">.fs-1 text</p>
<p class="fs-2">.fs-2 text</p>
<p class="fs-3">.fs-3 text</p>
<p class="fs-4">.fs-4 text</p>
<p class="fs-5">.fs-5 text</p>
<p class="fs-6">.fs-6 text</p>

Customize your available font-sizes by modifying the $font-sizes Sass map.
Font weight and italics

Quickly change the font-weight or font-style of text with these utilities. font-style utilities are abbreviated as .fst-* and font-weight utilities are abbreviated as .fw-*.

Bold text.

Bolder weight text (relative to the parent element).

Semibold weight text.

Normal weight text.

Light weight text.

Lighter weight text (relative to the parent element).

Italic text.

Text with normal font style
html

<p class="fw-bold">Bold text.</p>
<p class="fw-bolder">Bolder weight text (relative to the parent element).</p>
<p class="fw-semibold">Semibold weight text.</p>
<p class="fw-normal">Normal weight text.</p>
<p class="fw-light">Light weight text.</p>
<p class="fw-lighter">Lighter weight text (relative to the parent element).</p>
<p class="fst-italic">Italic text.</p>
<p class="fst-normal">Text with normal font style</p>

Line height

Change the line height with .lh-* utilities.

This is a long paragraph written to show how the line-height of an element is affected by our utilities. Classes are applied to the element itself or sometimes the parent element. These classes can be customized as needed with our utility API.

Text decoration

Decorate text in components with text decoration classes.

This text has a line underneath it.

html

<p class="text-decoration-underline">This text has a line underneath it.</p>
